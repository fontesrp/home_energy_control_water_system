# home_energy_control_water_system
Arduino sketch for controlling my home's water systems

Should considerably reduce the monthly ennergy consuption.
Expecting a 30% decrease.

The project consists of a clock and a digital pin controller.
I'm starting with an Arduino Uno R3 as the microcontroller, since only 8 digital ports and a very small quantity of memory are needed.
